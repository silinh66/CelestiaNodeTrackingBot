Step 1: Create a Telegram bot
The first step is to create a Telegram bot that will be used to check the node uptime. To create a bot, you can follow the instructions provided by Telegram on their website.

Step 2: Join the Telegram group
Next, you will need to join the Telegram group where you want to check the node uptime. You can either create your own group or join an existing one.

Step 3: Share the bot in the group
Once you have joined the group, you will need to share the bot in the group so that others can access it. To do this, you can either send the bot link or search for the bot in the group using the "@" symbol followed by the bot name.

Step 4: Enter the node ID
In order to check the node uptime, the user will need to enter the node ID into the group chat. The node ID is typically a string of letters and numbers that identifies the node.

Step 5: Use the bot command
Once the user has entered their node ID, they can use the bot command to check the node uptime. The bot command can be something like /uptime [node ID] or /check [node ID]. When the user enters the command, the bot will check the node uptime and return the result in the group chat.

Step 6: Interpret the result
The bot will provide the node uptime result in the group chat. The result can be interpreted by the user.
